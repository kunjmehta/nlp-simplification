# nlp-simplification
<h5>Code for Final Year Project at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering. The aim is to create a system that can take text as input in any format (JPEG, PDF) and simplify it by jargon 
removal.</h5>

-----------------------------------------
### Motivation, Challenge & Accomplishment

* **Motivation:** On researching and not finding a domain specific text simplification system (by removing technicalities in text) and sensing the need for one, we were motivated 
to further our interest in the data science and machine learning space by applying Natural Language Processing techniques to build a simplification model and wrap an application 
around it. 

* **Challenge:** Starting out, we did not know anything about NLP other than tokenization. The challenge for us was to read through research papers to understand the basics as well
as the advanced topics and come up with a system as well as a model architecture. Another challenge was finding a dataset suiting our needs.

* **Accomplishment:** Acquiring immense knowledge about NLP is our biggest accomplishment as part of this project. We were able to build and merge two different architectures into a pipeline for this project; We prepended a CWI model to imrpove the performance of the Transformer model for semantic simplification. In the end, we were able to build a proof-of-concept system using for simplification of complex words.
