To Whom It May Concern

I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of Mr. Kunj Mehta. We discussed
his recent decision to pursue graduate studies at your university. I applaud his decision and
strong desire to take his dedication and skill to the next level. He has worked as an intern at
Fractal Analytics, for a month.

As his mentor, I interacted very closely with him both individually as well as in a team. Kunj
was a part of the Big Data team on consumer analysis for a Fortune 500 company. His primary
task was to create a pipeline that detects and classifies product Stock Keeping Units of a leading
FMCG company in the US. The project required extensive practical knowledge of Machine
Learning and Pytorch. He built web scrappers to collect data and analyzed models for image
segmentation using an algorithm and Pytorch on Kaggle. Kunj also helped the team with
annotation of the dataset. His ability to comprehend and apply new concepts and his clarity of
understanding intricate concepts involved in the project never failed to impress me, and I would
rate his capability as being of very high standards.

At Fractal Analytics, Mumbai we continually recognize students who seek more than a career.
We recognize that Mr. Kunj Mehta possesses many of the necessary qualities to succeed in this
field. We have closely watched him whilst interacting with his team during the project. The thing
that impresses me the most about him is his thirst for new challenges, skill building and
developing a resourceful network of colleagues that respect and admire him.

It is my belief that a Master’s degree at your esteemed university will help Mr. Mehta to truly
succeed in the industry. I wish him luck for his future endeavors.

Sincerely,
